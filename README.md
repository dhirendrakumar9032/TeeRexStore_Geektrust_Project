## Documentation for TeeRexStore Project

### Overview

This project is a simple online store named "TeeRexStore" built using pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and view the total amount for the selected items. I created this project for the Geektrust Coding Challenge and received three badges for this project.

### Features

1. **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products with options to filter by color, gender, price, and type.
2. **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for products by name.
3. **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their cart and see the total amount.
4. **Delete Items**: Users can remove items from their cart.

### Project Structure

The project consists of two main HTML files:

1. `index.html` - The main page displaying the product listing and filters.
2. `shoppingCart.html` - The shopping cart page displaying the selected items and total amount.

### Files and Directories

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the product listing page.
- `shoppingCart.html`: The HTML file for the shopping cart page.
